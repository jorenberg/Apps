Applications and KnowledgeBases of [Sequømics Corporation](http://sequomics.com/).

<b>Sequomics Corporation</b>, is a startup innovative scientific and digital agency, commited to bring innovations into the human life; through building great data products, using Research and Discovery activity.

We worked very hard for you to develop the specialised products to do everyday research and discovery activity.

<b>Apps®</b>, is a central access to these <i>innovative scientific applications and knowledgebases</i>.

Apps®, is developed for <b>Single Sign-On (SSO)</b> <i>i.e.</i>, a property of access control of multiple related, but independent software systems. Using this feature any user logs in with a single <b>ID</b> and <b>password</b> to gain access to a connected system or systems without using different usernames or passwords, or in some configurations seamlessly sign on at each system.

Conversely, <b>single sign-off</b> is the feature whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to our multiple software systems.
